# sentiment-analysis-google-play

With millions of apps on the Google Play Store, manually analysing user reviews is time-consuming and inefficient. Users, developers, and marketers need an automated solution to quickly extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions on App Performance and User Satisfaction.

In this project, we create a website that takes google play application link and shows all text reviews and generates the overall sentiment and gives a decision based on overall positive sentiment percentage, as to whether the application's worth.
